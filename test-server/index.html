                So this started out life, just a few days ago, as a pattern library. I don't think that's the right
                direction though. Not for this package anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent a couple of days thinking about how to expose configuration for the components before coming to
                realise that that approach makes no sense. Why am I abstracting CSS inside CSS?
            </p>
            <p>
                So, instead of shipping a full pattern library, I think I'm going to publish just the bare essentials.
                The things you'll likely use on every project.
